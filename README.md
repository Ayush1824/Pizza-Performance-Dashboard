# Pizza-Performance-Dashboard
I’m excited to share a recent project where I built a Pizza Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau to solve real-world business challenges in the food & beverage sector.

## Project Objective:
To build an interactive Pizza Sales Dashboard that helps identify peak sales hours, best- and worst-selling products, and customer preferences by category and size. The goal was to solve real business challenges such as optimizing staffing, improving menu decisions, and increasing revenue through data-driven insights.

## DataSet Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Ayush1824/Pizza-Performance-Dashboard/blob/main/pizza_sales%20excel%20file.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Question (KPI's)

- What is the total revenue generated during the selected period?
- What is the average order value?
- How many total pizzas were sold?
- Which pizza category (Classic, Veggie, Supreme) generated the highest sales?
- Which pizza size (Small, Medium, Large) is most popular among customers?
- What are the top 5 best-selling pizzas?
- What are the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas?
- On which days of the week are sales the highest?
- What are the peak hours for customer orders?
- How do sales trend over time (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- Is there a correlation between pizza size and revenue generated?
- Which time slots require more staffing based on order volume?
- What is the customer purchase behavior by category and size?
- How consistent is revenue generation across days and hours?
- Are there underperforming pizzas that need to be reviewed or removed?

- Made sure that data is  consistent and clean with respect to data type,data formate and value used.
- Createad a pivot according to question asked.
- Merge all the pivot tables into one dashboard and apply yhe slicer to make ir dynamic.

## Project Insights:

- High Demand Periods: Orders peaked during weekends, especially Fridays and Saturdays between 12–2 PM and 5–8 PM, indicating when to allocate more staff and       prepare more inventory.

- Customer Preferences: Classic pizzas and Large sizes generated the most sales, showing a strong customer preference for traditional and shareable options.

- Product Performance Gaps: The bottom 5 pizzas had significantly lower sales, suggesting they may need promotion, repositioning, or removal from the menu.

- Revenue Drivers: A small group of pizzas contributed disproportionately to total revenue, reinforcing the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle) in menu performance.

- Sales Patterns: Clear trends in daily and hourly sales enabled better planning for offers, discounts, and targeted marketing campaigns.

## Conclusion:
- This project successfully transformed raw pizza sales data into a powerful decision-making tool using data visualization. The dashboard enabled business stakeholders to clearly understand customer behavior, product performance, and operational gaps. As a result, it supports more profitable, efficient, and customer-focused business strategies. This project demonstrates the real-world impact of data analytics in the F&B industry and the value of insightful dashboards in solving day-to-day business challenges.
