# Pizza-Performance-Dashboard
Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project where I built a Pizza Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau to solve real-world business challenges in the food & beverage sector.

## Project Objective:
To build an interactive Pizza Sales Dashboard that helps identify peak sales hours, best- and worst-selling products, and customer preferences by category and size. The goal was to solve real business challenges such as optimizing staffing, improving menu decisions, and increasing revenue through data-driven insights.

## DataSet Used

## Question (KPI's)

- What is the total revenue generated during the selected period?
- What is the average order value?
- How many total pizzas were sold?
- Which pizza category (Classic, Veggie, Supreme) generated the highest sales?
- Which pizza size (Small, Medium, Large) is most popular among customers?
- What are the top 5 best-selling pizzas?
- What are the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas?
- On which days of the week are sales the highest?
- What are the peak hours for customer orders?
- How do sales trend over time (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- Is there a correlation between pizza size and revenue generated?
- Which time slots require more staffing based on order volume?
- What is the customer purchase behavior by category and size?
- How consistent is revenue generation across days and hours?
- Are there underperforming pizzas that need to be reviewed or removed?
